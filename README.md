# Sentiment_Classifier_CourseraProject
In this project, we had built a code to perform sentiment analysis using Fake Twitter data.
This program takes a CSV file having fake data as input and analyze the amount of good and bad words by using positive words and negative words file. It will generate a CSV file as output with different heads such as number of retweets, number of replies, positive score, negative score, etc.
